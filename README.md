# 3D Racing Game
Welcome to the 3D Racing Game! This game was created for our Game Design 1 class at the University of Michigan-Dearborn and uses Unity as the game engine. It features fast-paced racing action against a computer AI opponent. The goal of the game is to be the first to cross the finish line after 1 lap. 

## Features
Realistic car physics, including the ability to drift around turns
Boost function to give you an extra burst of speed
Exciting races against a challenging AI opponent
Beautiful 3D graphics and immersive sound effects

## How to Play
To play the game, simply download the game and run it on your computer. Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to control the car, shift to drift and space bar to activate the boost function. Try to stay on the track and avoid crashing into walls or other obstacles. The first to cross the finish line after 1 lap wins the race.
